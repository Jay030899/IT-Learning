# Azure Fundamentals - Module 1 Notes

## Topic 1: Cloud Concepts

**Definition:**  
Cloud computing delivers IT resources like storage, servers, and networks over the internet.

**Basic Services:**  
- Compute power – add or remove computing power as needed  
- Storage – access to data as required

**Types of Cloud Services:**  
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**  
  - The consumer bears the most responsibility  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**  
  - Shared responsibility between provider and consumer  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
  - Provider handles most of the work; consumer manages the software

**Benefits:**  
- Scalability  
- Reliability  
- Pay-as-you-go

**Cloud Models:**  
- Determines the type of cloud resources you get based on services

 - ## Private Cloud

**Definition:**  
Your own personal cloud. Only your company can use it.

**Pros:**  
- Full control over everything

**Cons:**  
- More expensive than a public cloud  
- Less flexible than a public cloud

**Where it lives:**  
- In your own datacenter at your office  
- In a datacenter the consumer rents

  ## Public Cloud

**Definition:**  
Owned by someone else (e.g., Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud). Anyone can buy and use resources.

**Pros:**  
- Easy to scale  
- Cheaper than private cloud  
- No need to maintain hardware

**Cons:**  
- Less control over security  
- Less control over resources
## Hybrid Cloud

**Definition:**  
A mix of private and public cloud. Keep sensitive data in your private cloud and use the public cloud for extra or temporary workloads.

**Pros:**  
- Flexible  
- Can handle more traffic  
- Extra security
## Consumption-Based Model

**Definitions:**  
- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):** Buy it once, own it  
- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):** Pay as you go  

**Cloud Context:**  
- Cloud uses OpEx → only pay for what you use  
- Flexible and fast → scale up or down anytime  
- Saves money and time → no need to maintain servers or datacenters
