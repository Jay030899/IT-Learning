# Azure Fundamentals - Module 1 Notes

## Topic 1: Cloud Concepts

**Definition:**  
Cloud computing delivers IT resources like storage, servers, and networks over the internet.

**Basic Services:**  
- Compute power – add or remove computing power as needed  
- Storage – access to data as required

**Types of Cloud Services:**  
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**  
  - The consumer bears the most responsibility  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**  
  - Shared responsibility between provider and consumer  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
  - Provider handles most of the work; consumer manages the software

**Benefits:**  
- Scalability  
- Reliability  
- Pay-as-you-go

**Cloud Models:**  
- Determines the type of cloud resources you get based on services

 - ## Private Cloud

**Definition:**  
Your own personal cloud. Only your company can use it.

**Pros:**  
- Full control over everything

**Cons:**  
- More expensive than a public cloud  
- Less flexible than a public cloud

**Where it lives:**  
- In your own datacenter at your office  
- In a datacenter the consumer rents

  ## Public Cloud

**Definition:**  
Owned by someone else (e.g., Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud). Anyone can buy and use resources.

**Pros:**  
- Easy to scale  
- Cheaper than private cloud  
- No need to maintain hardware

**Cons:**  
- Less control over security  
- Less control over resources
## Hybrid Cloud

**Definition:**  
A mix of private and public cloud. Keep sensitive data in your private cloud and use the public cloud for extra or temporary workloads.

**Pros:**  
- Flexible  
- Can handle more traffic  
- Extra security
## Consumption-Based Model

**Definitions:**  
- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):** Buy it once, own it  
- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):** Pay as you go  

**Cloud Context:**  
- Cloud uses OpEx → only pay for what you use  
- Flexible and fast → scale up or down anytime  
- Saves money and time → no need to maintain servers or datacenters
## High Availability and Scalability

**High Availability:**  
- App always works  
- Azure guarantees uptime (SLA)

**Scalability:**  
- Adjust resources based on demand  
- **Vertical scaling:** make resources stronger or weaker (CPU/RAM)  
- **Horizontal scaling:** add or remove more resources (VMs/containers)

**Benefits:**  
- Users get smooth service  
- Save money by paying only for what you use
## Reliability, Predictability, Performance, and Cost

**Reliability:**  
- Keeps working even if something breaks  
- Cloud is decentralized and can auto-move resources

**Predictability:**  
- Helps plan performance and cost

**Performance:**  
- Autoscaling  
- Load balancing  
- High availability (HA)
## Topic: Security & Governance

### Governance
- Use templates, auditing, and automatic updates to stay compliant.

### Security
- With **IaaS**, you manage most of the security, so you get maximum control.  
- With **PaaS** and **SaaS**, the provider takes care of updates and security.  
- Cloud platforms also protect against big threats like DDoS attacks.

### Benefit
- You get a cloud environment that’s secure, compliant, and well-managed without doing all the heavy lifting yourself.


**Cost:**  
- Track, analyze, and forecast using tools
## Topic: Cloud Management

### Management **of** the cloud  
- The cloud comes with built-in automation tools.  
- Examples: autoscaling, templates, monitoring, and alerts.  
- These tools handle the heavy lifting for you so things run smoothly.  

### Management **in** the cloud  
- This is how you actually control and manage resources yourself.  
- Options include:  
  - Azure Portal (web interface)  
  - Command Line Interface (CLI)  
  - APIs  
  - PowerShell  
## Azure = More Than Just Renting Servers

Azure isn’t only about hosting servers — it’s a full platform:

-  **Innovation Platform**  
  Supports AI, Machine Learning, and automation to build smarter apps.

-  **Global Scale**  
  Fast, reliable, and secure infrastructure across Microsoft’s worldwide datacenters.

-  **Trusted & Secure**  
  Backed by Microsoft’s compliance standards and enterprise-grade security.

-  **Flexible**  
  Use your choice of tools, languages, and frameworks.
